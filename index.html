    	<h2>1. What is Vinted ? </h2>
	    <p>
	    	Vinted is an online marketplace, which is a digital platform that connects buyers and sellers removing the need for a physical space, such as a shop, to exchange goods. Vinted was set up in 2008 in Lithuania by two friends – one of whom simply wanted to clear out some space in their closet. The platform now has 105 million users across more than 20 different countries, including 16 million users in the UK.
If you are looking to buy or sell, you just need to download the app and set up an account. There are no fees to pay as a seller, unlike on Ebay. Instead the buyer pays a protection fee as well as covering the postage of the item. Sellers can purchase extra features to try to get their item sold faster
